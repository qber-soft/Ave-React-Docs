Avernakis is a C++ UI library used to create desktop applications, for ease of development, we provide API in JavaScript(thanks to napi!).

This site is mainly about these JavaScript APIs.

## Avernakis Native

[Avernakis C++ SDK ](https://github.com/qber-soft/Ave-SDK/blob/main/README_en-us.md) is versatileï¼Œyou can find demo here: [AvernakisApp.7z](https://github.com/qber-soft/Ave-SDK/releases/download/0.8.0/AvernakisApp.7z).

> Download it, and then open 'Spellcaster-Gui-Image/Bin64/Test-Gui.exe'

This video briefly shows various UI components of it:

## JS API

Currently, we only get a subset of it in JS, there is still much to do.
